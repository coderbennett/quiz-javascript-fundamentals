## **Extra Notes**

---

In this section I will preview some code snippets I found the most interesting and/or fun to work on with this project.

### **Using Local Storage**

When using local storage, it is important to remember that everything stored there must be a string. In this case we are using the JSON.stringify method to update the highscores object.

    localStorage.setItem("highScores", JSON.stringify(highScores));

Without the stringify method, the local storage would not be able to store the variable properly.

To continue on an important note with using local storage, when taking data from local storage we must parse it to "unstringify" in our case the highscores array with objects.

    highScores = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("highScores"));

### **Generating HTML Elements with JavaScript**

A tricky part of this project was creating the list of highscore stats. This is because we cannot know how many highscores will be stored at any one time and we must make it responsive to that number. Luckily, we have iterators like for loops to tackle this problem.

    for (var i = 0; i < highScores.length; i++) {

    liArray[i] = document.createElement("li");

    highscoresEl.appendChild(liArray[i]);

    liArray[i].textContent = highScores[i].initials + ": " + highScores[i].highscore;
    }

This for loop checks our highscores array to see how many highscores have been saved, then creates an HTML element for each of them, appends those as children to the highscores list element, and lastly sets text content for those elements.
