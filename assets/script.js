// start game with button
// to do this we will need an addeventlistener with
// a quiz function

// the quiz function will likely be the mother function
// she will have all the other functions within

// there will need to be a function that displays
// the current question, with all the children
// answers/responses

// there will need to be a function that holds each question?
// possibly a questions object that holds all the 
// questions as objects and the questions have
// answers as values within

// there will need to be a timer function
// we need to ensure that time is subtracted from
// this timer when you answer incorrectly

// gameOver function, which should be the same for
// either completing all the questions or running out 
// of time

// highscores page which holds all the scores on localStorage
